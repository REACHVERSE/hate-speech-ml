### **Block 1: Foundational Assessment & Planning** ✅
1. **Current System Performance Benchmark Report**  
   - Measure existing model metrics (F1, precision, recall) and program resource usage (CPU/RAM/inference latency) as a baseline
2. **Dataset Audit & Enhancement Plan**  
   - Identify gaps in training data (e.g., underrepresented hate categories) and propose sourcing/cleaning strategies
3. **Tech Stack Evaluation Matrix**  
   - Compare lightweight alternatives (ONNX, FastAPI, LiteLLM) vs current dependencies with resource/performance tradeoffs
4. **Optimization Target Definition**  
   - Document specific KPI targets (e.g., 50% model size reduction, 2x inference speed, <500MB RAM usage)

### **Block 2: Core Model Evolution** ✅
5. **Lightweight Model Prototypes (3 Variants)**  
   - Implement distilled architectures (e.g., DistilBERT, TinyLSTM) with quantization-aware training
5. **Bias Mitigation Module**  
   - Integrate fairness metrics (e.g., AIF360) and demographic parity checks into training pipeline
7. **Contextual Enhancement Pipeline**  
   - Add tweet-specific preprocessing (emojis/URLs/slang handling) and feature engineering
8. **Model Compression Implementation**  
   - Apply pruning + quantization to optimal prototype; validate accuracy/resource tradeoffs

### **Block 3: Program Optimization**
9. **Microservice Architecture Refactor**  
   - Decouple components into Dockerized services (scraper → preprocessor → model → API) with async I/O
9. **Memory Optimization Blueprint**  
    - Implement smart batching, response caching, and lazy loading dependencies
10. **X API Compliance Overhaul**  
    - Migrate to Twitter API v2 with compliant data handling and exponential backoff retry logic
11. **Lightweight Inference Server**  
    - Replace Flask with FastAPI/Starlette + ONNX Runtime serving; benchmark throughput gains

### **Block 4: Efficiency & Scalability**
13. **Edge Deployment Package**  
    - Create a <100MB container with minimal OS (Alpine) and hardware-aware inference configs
14. **Auto-Scaling Trigger System**  
    - Design load-based resource adjuster (e.g., scale model workers on queue length)
15. **Continuous Training Pipeline**  
    - Build automated data drift detection + model retraining workflow (TFX/Kubeflow)
16. **Security Hardening Suite**  
    - Add rate limiting, input sanitization, and model watermarking protections

---

### **Block 5: Validation & Future-Proofing**
17. **Performance Validation Dashboard**  
    - Interactive report comparing new vs old KPIs with resource/accuracy tradeoff visualizations
18. **Ambiguous Case Handling Framework**  
    - Implement human-in-the-loop workflow for borderline predictions (confidence thresholding)
19. **Multi-Platform Deployment Kits**  
    - Generate build pipelines for AWS Lambda, Docker Hub, and Raspberry Pi targets
20. **Automated Technical Playbook**  
    - Self-documenting CLI tool reproducing entire setup/model training with <3 commands

**Progression Logic:**  
- **Blocks 1-2** focus on data/model improvements (accuracy ↑, size ↓)  
- **Blocks 3-4** target system efficiency (speed ↑, resources ↓)  
- **Block 5** ensures measurable impact and deployability  
- Each block delivers testable artifacts (reports/code/modules) for clear intern evaluation
